          <p>
            This visual essay will narrate the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic
            around the world, and the effect the vaccines had on the scale of
            the outbreak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, we will examine how the pandemic spread across different
            countries and continents from its onset. Next, we will see which
            countries most successfully managed the pandemic. We will also
            investigate whether there is a correlation between the relative
            wealth of a country and the spread of the pandemic. Additionally, we
            will look at the impact of vaccinations on the spread of cases and
            deaths, and whether booster jabs also affected the spread and
            transmissibility of the virus. Finally, we will consider how the
            geographical position of a country might have influenced the impact
            of the pandemic on them.
