          <p>
            This visual essay will narrate the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic
            around the world, and the effect the vaccines had on the scale of
            the outbreak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, we will examine how the pandemic spread across different
            countries and continents from its onset. Next, we will see how the
            G7 countries managed the pandemic. We will also investigate whether
            there is a correlation between the relative wealth of a country and
            the spread of the pandemic. Finally, we will look at the impact of
            vaccinations on the spread of cases and deaths.

          chart shows that only Japan had lower deaths per 1M people than the

          The above chart shows vaccinations had a positive effect on the number
          of cases globally. As the number of vaccinations rises, the number of
          deaths slows.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this visual essay, we have seen how the pandemic spread across the
          globe, starting in China, Germany and Finland, then across Western
          Europe, North America, and Southeast Asia, then grow rapidly across
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also compared how the G7 countries handled the pandemic compared to
          the global average and found a correlation between the relative wealth
          of a country and the spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also concluded that the vaccinations has a large effect in reducing
          the spread of deaths.
